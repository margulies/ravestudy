Method Info:

- Two groups (201 & 202) of rocking in six chairs positioned in a circle.

- Participants: Colby undergraduate students (no prior knowledge about coordination).

- Continuation paradigm: Participants practiced rocking to a metronome (.6 Hz) for 30 s prior to completing experimental trials

- Two Trial Types:	1 x EC = Eyes closed,  control/baseline condition to measure chance level coordination -- completed first.
			2 x EO = Eyes open, instructed to coordinate. -- completed last.


Data info:

- Data length 120 s (7200 data points)

- Motion sensors attached to head-rest of chairs using Polhemus liberty 8 systems. 

- Movements recorded in z direction (up-down).

- Samplerate: 60 Hz (downsampled from 120 Hz).

- Each column in the data files is the z data for each chair. [i.e., 	ch1z	ch2z	ch3z	ch4z	ch5z	ch6z]
